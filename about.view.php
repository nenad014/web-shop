        <p class="text-justify">On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
            in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
            and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our
            power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
            best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
            owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that
            pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
            these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
            pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
